                  The Livability App is designed to address the need for comprehensive information regarding the livability of different neighborhoods so users can make an informed decision during relocation utilizing metrics beyond just housing cost. Factors such as air quality, life expectancy, walkability, and rent make a significant impact on quality of life. Information across different areas and regions is often fragmented and difficult to compare. By providing a comprehensive comparative analysis of neighborhoods, we aspire to help users find an ideal neighborhood based on their lifestyle and preferences. Utilizing data on these key livability metrics, our app seeks to create a central space for users to gather all the data they need to make an informed decision on where they want to live.

                  The objective of this project is to enhance Customer Experience and Business Performance through Data-Driven Insights for the participating businesses on Yelp. Utilizing the data on customer reviews, customer profiles, and business profiles, I determined key features in the business profile/customer profile that influence a customerâ€™s impression of a business, endeavored to estimate a customer's rating based on a business, and provided ways for businesses to address identifiable trends in customer rating behaviors.
